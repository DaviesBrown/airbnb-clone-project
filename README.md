## Feature Breakdown
Hereâ€™s a list of the **main features** from the Airbnb Clone Project, along with short descriptions of how each contributes to the overall platform:

### 1. **User Management**
Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile settings.  
This feature ensures that users can securely access the platform, manage their accounts, and distinguish between roles such as guest and host.


### 2. **Property Management**
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings.  
It enables the platform to showcase available accommodations, providing essential details like location, pricing, photos, and amenities to attract potential guests.


### 3. **Booking System**
Enables guests to reserve available properties and view their booking history.  
This is the core functionality of the application, ensuring users can select dates, check availability, and complete the reservation process seamlessly.


### 4. **Payment Processing**
